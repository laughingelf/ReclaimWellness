                <p>
                Former Navy Sailor, developed a passion for using massage as a tool for helping people recover 
                from  physical and mental traumas because I used it for my own healing. My passions lead me to 
                studying how to become a meditation/breathwork coach, somatic experiencing, trauma-informed massage/yoga, 
                somatic movement massage, massage for anxiety and depression, and massage for PTSD. I am always excited 
                to help my clients through their healing journey with touch therapy.
